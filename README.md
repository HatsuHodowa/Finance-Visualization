# Financial Reality Fork

## Note
This is a fork of a HackNC 2025 project called Financial Reality, being developed for my own finance visualization purposes. Below is the original description from the hackathon project.

## Introduction
A VR application that allows you to view visualizations of your personal finances
at the scale of physical objects instead of numbers.

A web interface is provided to allow uploading of statements as a CSV (Capital One format).
The web interface is hosted at [financialreality.photo](https://financialreality.photo)

## To Use
Financial Reality is built in Unity version **6000.2.6f2**

Clone the repository to your system and add the project to Unity. 

### Testing
Connect a headset to your system and hit play. This let's you explore the environment with VR mode.

To test without a headset, in Unity:
**Edit->Project Settings->XR-Plugin Management->XR Interaction Toolkit**  
Turn **Use XR Interaction Simulation in scenes** on  
You can now play the environments without a headset.
