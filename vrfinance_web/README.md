# Web Interface for VR Finance app

## About

As the world becomes increasingly digitized, the act of spending money starts
to feel less tangible, making it easier to frivolously overspend. VR Finance
is a VR game that helps intuitivaly visualize your spending habits in 3D at the
scale of physical objects in the real world.

## Web Interface

The web interface is a full stack web application that allows users to upload
bank statements in a CSV format for the VR application to access. Currently,
it works best with CSV format generated by Capital One.

## How to run

The easiest way to run this application is with Docker Compose. Please ensure
you have Docker installed and the Docker Engine running.

Simply run `sudo docker compose up --build` in the root directory to run the project.
The frontend container will run nginx and will expose an HTTP server on port 80.

To support HTTPS traffic, first run `sudo scripts/init-cert.sh`, changing the
domain name and email to your appropriate values, and then run
`sudo docker compose up --build`.
